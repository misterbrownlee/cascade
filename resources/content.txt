At Cascade Valuation Service, we assist those who own, manage, sell, invest in and/or lend money on the security of real estate by providing objective, impartial and unbiased opinions about the value of real property. Our extensive experience and education provide us with the strong analytical skills necessary to develop an opinion of market value.
 
What is an appraisal?
An appraisal is a professional appraiser's opinion of market value. The preparation of an appraisal involves research into appropriate market areas, the analysis of information pertinent to a property and the knowledge, experience and professional judgment of the appraiser. Appraisers assemble a series of facts, statistics and other information regarding specific properties in order to provide evidence supporting an opinion of current market value. The appraiser provides a professional, unbiased opinion of market value which is used in making real estate decisions.

Home Inspector? Appraiser?
The appraiser is not a home inspector nor does he/she do a complete home inspection. An inspection is a third-party evaluation of the accessible structure and mechanical systems of a house, from the roof to the foundation. The standard home inspector's report will include an evaluation of the condition of the home's heating system, central air conditioning system (temperature permitting), interior plumbing and electrical systems; the roof, attic, and visible insulation; walls, ceilings, floors, windows and doors; the foundation, basement, and visible structure.
